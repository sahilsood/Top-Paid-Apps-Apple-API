Built an Android Applciation, that makes RESTful API calls to the Apple top paid applications. Performed JSON parsing on retrieved data. Displayed using custom built ListView Adapter. 

User can longClick gesture and select applications, and add to filterd list, which is a horizontal Recycler view. 

Adding applications to filtered list removes applications from the main list. 

Deleting applications from filtered list, puts back applications to main list.
